This is a small console app designed for monitoring pod statuses in multiple namespaces. 

At this moment it is mainly aimed at MacOS. 

### Shortcuts/Hotkeys:
- `1-9` - copy commands to clipboard, more info in app footer
- `e` - expand all namespaces
- `c` - collapse all elements
- `left` - collapse item / navigate to parent item
- `right` - expand item
- `PgUp` - scroll up a page
- `PgDn` - scroll down a page
- `Home` - scroll to the top
- `End` - scroll to the end

### How to use:
#### **Please note, each `context/namespace` pair is a separate `get pods` call to Kubernetes with your credentials every 5 seconds, so be considerate with the number of namespaces you are monitoring.** 

- Download latest release from [releases page](https://github.com/JLevconoks/k8ConsoleViewer/releases)
- Run `./k8ConsoleViewer -c <context> -n <namespace>` 

Namespace name can contain wildcards for example 'foo*bar' will be converted to regex `^foo.*bar$` and compared to all namespaces in given context. Regex itself is not available, for now. 

**When using wildcard namespace name need to be in quotes, to correctly pass parameter to the application.**
`./k8ConsoleViewer -c foo -n "bar*"`

Alternatively:
- Create `groups.json` file alongside your download in the format similar to `groups-sample.json` 
- Run `./k8ConsoleViewer group <id>` or `./k8ConsoleViewer group <name>` based on the groups.json
- Run `./k8ConsoleViewer group` to view available groups 

Symlink to /url/local/bin to launch it from anywhere 
```
ln -s <path to the app executable> /usr/local/bin/<prefered name>
``` 
for example `ln -s ~/Tools/k8ConsoleViewer/k8ConsoleViewer /usr/local/bin/k8viewer`

### Updating the app
- Run `./k8ConsoleViewer update` and follow the instructions. 
This will get latest release(if different), backup existing app and replace it with a new version.
